# lastfm-utils
Collection of Python programs for analysing Last.fm data maintained by [@duh](https://www.github.com/duh) and [@apr1lfm](https://www.github.com/apr1lfm). You are free to use these in your own projects - credit would be appreciated!

## How do I use these?
You must have a Last.fm API key to use these programs. You can apply for one [here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create). Simply set the value of the `API_KEY` variable in **lastfm-api.py** to the API key generated by Last.fm.
The Python `requests` module is required for most of these scripts. You can install it from the terminal using `pip install requests`

## âš  Disclaimer
You are responsible for your use of these programs, and must follow the [API Terms of Service](https://www.last.fm/api/tos)
