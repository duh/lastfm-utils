# lastfm-utils
Collection of Python programs for analysing Last.fm data. You are free to use these in your own projects - credit would be appreciated!

## How do I use these?
You must have a Last.fm API key to use these programs. You can apply for one [here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create). Simply set the value of the `API_KEY` variable at the top of a program to the API key generated by Last.fm.

## âš  Disclaimer
You are responsible for your use of these programs, and must follow the [API Terms of Service](https://www.last.fm/api/tos)
