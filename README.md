# lastfm-utils
Collection of Python programs for analysing Last.fm data maintained by [@duh](https://www.github.com/duh) and [@apr1lfm](https://www.github.com/apr1lfm). You are free to use these in your own projects - credit would be appreciated!

## How do I use these?
You must have a Last.fm API key to use these programs. You can apply for one [here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create). 
<br>You must download the **FMcreds.py** file, place it in the same directory as any downloaded scripts, and set the value of the `API_KEY` variable to the API key generated by Last.fm.
<br>The **FMapi.py** contains key functions, and must also be downloaded and placed in the same directory as any saved scripts.
<br>The Python `requests` module is also required for most of these scripts. You can install it from the terminal using `pip install requests`

## âš  Disclaimer
You are responsible for your use of these programs, and must follow the [API Terms of Service](https://www.last.fm/api/tos)
